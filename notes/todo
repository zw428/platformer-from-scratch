add attacks to creature (probably part of task below)
	make it so you can't start another attack until one of them is over. attack_manager?
		make different attacks for if holding a direction

more advanced attacks
	delay after attack (not cooldown) (like after a punch, need to recover, still can't move)
	attacks where you can't move
	charged attacks
	hold-down attacks

player-player collision shouldn't be possible, or else hitting is lame

level_loader: make it so you add invisible collision boxes and not-invisible images
