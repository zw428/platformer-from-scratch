death/spawn mechanism
	(death class that has on_death overloadable function)
		on_death (teleport, health = blah)

	spawning:
		"disable_movement" timer

		levitate and draw platform under until move disable timer over
			just make weightless and draw platform under


jumper class that allows double jump, etc

ledge grabbing

make a class that handles "if moving left, if jumping etc" that npc and player
both INHERIT from. so they can both call something like
"set_image_walking_left()", etc. probably make a "image* current" that's drawn,
soon to be "anim* current"

maybe tests at some point
