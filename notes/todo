slim down player class (think function is too big)
	directed_attack doesn't need to be a class, has no state
	make a class that:
		has an attack and delayed_action
		has a box* used for source
		has w/h for attack and bullet dimens
		has x/y offset (offset from source, used for attack and bullet pos)
		make directed_attack a bullet that doesn't move with a lifespan?????? makes things simpler

make knockback more interesting; hits things in air. might not need after better attacks

make it so you can't start another attack until one of them is over. attack_manager?

more advanced attacks
	attacks where you can't move
	charged attacks
	hold-down attacks

player-player collision shouldn't be possible, or else hitting is lame
