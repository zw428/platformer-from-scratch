test out attack manager by finishing move set for player

make consts load from file

add zooming/panning

more advanced attacks
	add recovery time
	attacks where you can't move
	charged attacks
	hold-down attacks

player-player collision shouldn't be possible, or else hitting is lame

level_loader: make it so you add invisible collision boxes and not-invisible images
