make another class like alive that has damage instead of health, handles knockback (more knockback the more damage it has)
	overload attack perform() to accept that class too
	probably do alive inherited with 1 health so it can still be killed

death/spawn mechanism
	(death class that has on_death overloadable function)
		on_death (teleport, health = blah)

	spawning:
		"disable_movement" timer

		levitate and draw platform under until move disable timer over
			just make weightless and draw platform under


jumper class that allows double jump, etc

ledge grabbing

make a class that handles "if moving left, if jumping etc" that npc and player
both INHERIT from. so they can both call something like
"set_image_walking_left()", etc. probably make a "image* current" that's drawn,
soon to be "anim* current"

maybe tests at some point
