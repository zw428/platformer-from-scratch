test out attack manager by finishing move set for player
	make attacks/anims load from file

more advanced attacks
	delay after attack (not cooldown) (like after a punch, need to recover, still can't move)
	attacks where you can't move
	charged attacks
	hold-down attacks

player-player collision shouldn't be possible, or else hitting is lame

level_loader: make it so you add invisible collision boxes and not-invisible images
