make 1time attack box by deriving from attack box, call attack_box::action, then return true
	should also make it always be destroyed when hitting a block.

	keep in mind if something is virtual, you can still probably do (in derived class) parent::function.
		that way you can add to think functions and stuff

slim down player class (think function is too big)
	directed_attack doesn't need to be a class, has no state
	make a class that:
		has an attack and delayed_action
		has a box* used for source
		has w/h for attack and bullet dimens
		has x/y offset (offset from source, used for attack and bullet pos)

make it so you can't start another attack until one of them is over. attack_manager?

more advanced attacks
	attacks where you can't move
	charged attacks
	hold-down attacks

player-player collision shouldn't be possible, or else hitting is lame
