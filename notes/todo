refactor gravity_affected, etc.
	try to back away from multiple inheritance and just override think()
	but call parent::think() inside it (you didn't know you could do this)

slim down player class (think function is too big)

make it so you can't start another attack until one of them is over. attack_manager?

more advanced attacks
	attacks where you can't move
	charged attacks
	hold-down attacks

player-player collision shouldn't be possible, or else hitting is lame
