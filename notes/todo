move knocking back out of attack_box? and fix it to knock back to right

get rid of dynamic casts that you probably don't need

ledge grabbing

make a class that handles "if moving left, if jumping etc" that npc and player
both INHERIT from. so they can both call something like
"set_image_walking_left()", etc. probably make a "image* current" that's drawn,
soon to be "anim* current"

maybe tests at some point
