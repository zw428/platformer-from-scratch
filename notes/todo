slim down player class (think function is too big)

more advanced attacks
	better way to set origin, for when punch/whatever extends hitbox. probably have to do it with coordinates
	attacks where you can't move
	charged attacks
	hold-down attacks

make knockback more interesting; hits things in air

player-player collision shouldn't be possible, or else hitting is lame
