re-implement npc

add attacks to creature (probably part of task below)

make it so you can't start another attack until one of them is over. attack_manager?

more advanced attacks
	attacks where you can't move
	charged attacks
	hold-down attacks

player-player collision shouldn't be possible, or else hitting is lame
