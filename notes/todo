make a text class -> make damage numbers

friction

class that handles handle_movement( bool up, bool right, bool down, bool left)

trigger for death if falling off stage

make a class that handles "if moving left, if jumping etc" that npc and player
both INHERIT from. so they can both call something like
"set_image_walking_left()", etc. probably make a "image* current" that's drawn,
soon to be "anim* current"

viewport

maybe tests at some point
