turn trigger into a not-solid object to make map->think more easy

slim down player class (think function is too big)

more advanced attacks
	bullets - add tests, make not solid
	attacks where you can't move
	charged attacks
	hold-down attacks

make knockback more interesting; hits things in air

player-player collision shouldn't be possible, or else hitting is lame
