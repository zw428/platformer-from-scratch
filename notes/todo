make attacks/anims for player load from file
	probably remove anim_handler origin stuff and just have
	offset for each type of image, so player image size for
	attacks doesn't matter

test out attack manager by finishing move set for player

make consts load from file

add zooming/panning

more advanced attacks
	add recovery time
	attacks where you can't move
	charged attacks
	hold-down attacks

player-player collision shouldn't be possible, or else hitting is lame

level_loader: make it so you add invisible collision boxes and not-invisible images
