redo how attacks work
	make attackable derive from object... receive_attack remains virtual till you define it from something eriving from moving_box_object

remove manager multiple inheritance

call parent::think() inside stuff instead of multiple inheritance
	do this for image/anim

remove pointers where possible, replace with references

slim down player class (think function is too big)

make it so you can't start another attack until one of them is over. attack_manager?

more advanced attacks
	attacks where you can't move
	charged attacks
	hold-down attacks

player-player collision shouldn't be possible, or else hitting is lame
