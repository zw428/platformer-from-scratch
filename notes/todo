fix: without shared ptr, box objects don't get called delete on from grid erase (so if it doesn't exist anywhere on grid, it doesn't get erased)
	figure out what's going on with the grid now that there's no shared ptr

add attacks to creature (probably part of task below)
	make it so you can't start another attack until one of them is over. attack_manager?
		make different attacks for if holding a direction

make attacks hit in a static direction (not based on player to player angle)

more advanced attacks
	attacks where you can't move
	charged attacks
	hold-down attacks

player-player collision shouldn't be possible, or else hitting is lame

level_loader: make it so you add invisible collision boxes and not-invisible images
