My untitled open source game!

# Instructions
- `make`
- `build/unknown`

# Notes
- I wrote a script for getting dependencies that should probably be written in something other than bash. So for now, you need to have bash to compile this project.
- I have never tested this project on anything but Linux.

# Contributing / TODO
- The Catch tests can serve as a description of whatever you're looking at. Look at those if you get confused!
- Organize. A lot of things could be put in folders to make the project easier to navigate. That would be easier with a better makefile.
- Please add tests for contributions you make!
- The goal of this project is to make a platforming game. I have no specific ideas for what direction the game should go, so feel free to add whatever you like.
