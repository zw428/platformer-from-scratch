My untitled open source game!

# Instructions
- download boo-city.ttf from somewhere and move it into `data/fonts/`
- `mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..`
- `make`
- `./platformer-from-scratch`
- `./tests`

# Notes
- I have never tested this project on anything but Linux.

# Contributing / TODO
- Look at notes/todo for what needs to be done, other than that:
- The Catch tests can serve as a description of whatever you're looking at. Look at those if you get confused!
- Please add tests for contributions you make!
- The goal of this project is to make a platforming game. I have no specific ideas for what direction the game should go, so feel free to add whatever you like.
